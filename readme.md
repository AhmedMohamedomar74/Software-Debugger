# Software Debugger with GUI for Microcontroller Communication via UART

## Overview
This software debugger is designed to facilitate debugging processes for microcontroller-based projects. It provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interacting with the microcontroller via UART communication. With this debugger, users can read data from any register and write data to any register, enabling efficient debugging and testing of embedded systems.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Intuitive interface for easy interaction with the debugger.
- **Read and Write Operations**: Ability to read data from any register and write data to any register on the microcontroller.
- **UART Communication**: Establishes communication with the microcontroller through UART interface.
- **Real-time Data Display**: Displays data read from the microcontroller registers in real-time.
- **User-friendly Controls**: Simple controls for initiating read and write operations.

## Installation
1. **Install PyQt**: You need to install PyQt library. If you haven't installed it yet, you can install it using 
    
    `pip install PyQt5`
2. **Install PySerial**: PySerial library is required for serial communication with the microcontroller. If you haven't installed it yet, you can install it using pip:
    
    `pip install pyserial`
3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
    git clone

   `https://github.com/AhmedMohamedomar74/Software-Debugger.git`

5. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all other required dependencies are installed. Detailed instructions can be found in the `README.md` file of the repository.

## Usage
1. **Connect Microcontroller**: Connect your microcontroller to your computer using UART communication.
2. **Launch Debugger**: Run the debugger application.
3. **GUI Interface**: Utilize the GUI interface to perform read and write operations on the microcontroller registers.
4. **View Data**: Monitor the data read from the registers in real-time on the GUI.
5. **Debugging**: Use the debugger to troubleshoot and debug issues in your microcontroller-based projects.
